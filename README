// Slip days
I am using one of my 4 remaining slip days.

// Brief overview
	After compiling the src codes lab1b-server.c and
	lab1b-client.c, there will be 2 executables in this package:
	lab1b-server and lab1b-client. lab1b-server starts up a server
	which will fork a child process that executes a shell
	process. lab1b-client will start up a client that will be able
	to communicate with the server through a port. The client will
	receive input from the keyboard, echo it to the terminal, and
	send it to the server through the use of sockets. The server
	will then forward it to the shell process via pipes. When the
	shell outputs the results of the commands sent by the keybaord
	from the client, the server will receive it and forward it to
	the client, which will then display on the terminal.

	The client will also have a --log option to log any bytes sent
	to or received from the server. Both the client and the server
	will have a --encrypt option to encrypt and decrypt the data
	being sent to each other, using the algorithm "twofish" in
	"cfb" mode with the help of the mcrypt.h library.
